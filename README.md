_##A special note for a particular issue some users can face in the project##_

_Upon initializing <npm run start>, the following message may be prompted on the terminal._
'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
To eliminate that: You can use <npm install> to acquire the missing dependencies.

_But during npm install, the following error can occur:_
npm WARN deprecated stable@0.1.8: Modern JS already guarantees Array#sort() is a stable sort, so this library is deprecated. See the compatibility table on MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#browser_compatibility

The warning message received indicates that the package 'stable' you have installed is deprecated. The 'stable' package was previously used to provide a stable sorting algorithm for older versions of JavaScript that did not guarantee the stability of the `Array#sort()` method. However, modern versions of JavaScript now ensure that `Array#sort()` is a stable sort, making the 'stable' package unnecessary.

The warning message suggests referring to the compatibility table on MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) to understand the browser compatibility of the `Array#sort()` method. The table provides information about which browser versions support stable sorting using `Array#sort()`.

_To address this issue:_
we can simply use the command:
<npm update stable>

After this when we again run the command: <npm run start>, the website will work just fine.
